### Functionalities and Experience to Obtain

List containing functionalities I would like to have, either through building my own packages or wrapping existing packages.  Code should be written with proper error handling, best practice conventions, etc.  Upon completion, insure that all loops are optimized.

Some of these I already have, some I do not.  Strike throughs indicate partially complete, bold strike throughs fully complete.

Conventions are to be as follow:  underscore separation for methods, capitalized camel case class, lowercased camel cased files (makes for easier directory traversing)

4. voip phone
5. TCP communication
6. Internet connection testing
7. Webscraper with condensed interface for commonly searched terms, elements, etc.
